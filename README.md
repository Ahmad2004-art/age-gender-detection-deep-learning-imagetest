Age & Gender Detection from Images
📌 Overview

This project is a Deep Learning–based system that predicts age and gender from face images.
It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained with TensorFlow / Keras to perform inference on static images.

The project focuses on image-based testing, making it simple and efficient for offline evaluation.
